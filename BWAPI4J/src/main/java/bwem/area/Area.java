/**
 * Areas are regions that BWEM automatically computes from Brood War's maps.<br/>
 * Areas aim at capturing relevant regions that can be walked, though they may contain small inner non walkable regions called lakes.<br/>
 * More formally:<br/>
 *  - An area consists in a set of 4-connected MiniTiles, which are either Terrain-MiniTiles or Lake-MiniTiles.<br/>
 *  - An Area is delimited by the side of the Map, by Water-MiniTiles, or by other Areas. In the latter case
 *    the adjoining Areas are called neighboring Areas, and each pair of such Areas defines at least one ChokePoint.<br/>
 * Like ChokePoints and Bases, the number and the addresses of Area instances remain unchanged.<br/>
 * To access Areas one can use their ids or their addresses with equivalent efficiency.<br/>
 *
 * Areas inherit utils::Markable, which provides marking ability.<br/>
 * Areas inherit utils::UserData, which provides free-to-use data.
